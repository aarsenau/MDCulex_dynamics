From 2019-2021, the authors collected mosquitoes via gravid traps from 15 sites in Washington D.C. and Maryland. Cryptic Culex specimens were molecularly identified to assess patterns of community composition, habitat use, and seasonality among these species. 
This script is associated with that analysis, and includes analysis of cryptic Culex community assemblages and associations with environmental variables using contingency table analysis, NMDS, and CCA. We also assessed Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium of Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus populations at the CQ11 locus.
